# Design Teardown

The goal for this project is to assess the visual hierarchy of this [Smashing Magazine page](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) by creating a heat map. Elements that are a darker shade should indicate areas where a user's eyes are drawn first.

A secondary objective is to practice importing fonts, in this case from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

So the obvious question is... **how did they do?** How does the design enhance the UX of the site?

Well, as a site that hosts articles and workshops about UX/UI and front-end design, the designers of this site obviously have much more experience than I do. That said...

As a newcomer to the site, I might find it more useful to have their "Smashing Guides" closer to the top of the page rather than the big sign-up form for their newsletter. But that's probably an intentional decision on their part - they're probably prioritizing getting peoples' emails.

Otherwise, I think it strikes a good balance of sleek visual appeal without being "over-designed."
